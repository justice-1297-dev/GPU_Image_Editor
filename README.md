# Homework 01 - Image Editing

## Overview

Your task in this assignment is to change the c program in [main.cpp](https://github.umn.edu/CSCI-3081-01-F25/private-hw01/blob/main/main.cpp) into a c++ program that uses classes.  You will read through the comments looking for opportunities to create objects.  You are to define the abstract data types using C++ classes.  An image editor probably has classes like Application, Image, Window, Texture, TexturedRectange, etc...

Define your classes and copy code out of main.cpp into the classes that you write.  Be sure to change the [Makefile](https://github.umn.edu/CSCI-3081-01-F25/private-hw01/blob/main/Makefile) to build your all your classes.  We may build or explore a few of these abstract data types during class or in lab.
